The ASCII value of a string is the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the string. \n\nLet's calculate the ASCII values for both \"Lagos\" and \"Los Angeles\":\n\n1. \"Lagos\": L(76) + a(97) + g(103) + o(111) + s(115) = 502\n2. \"Los Angeles\": L(76) + o(111) + s(115) + A(65) + n(110) + g(103) + e(101) + l(108) + e(101) + s(115) = 904\n\nNow, subtract the ASCII value of \"Lagos\" from \"Los Angeles\":\n\n904 - 502 = 402\n\nSo, the answer is 402.",
