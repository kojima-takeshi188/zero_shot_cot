Then, he loses 8 water type cards, reducing the total to 82 cards. He then buys 14 more grass type cards, increasing the total to 96 cards. The number of water type cards is now 40 - 8 = 32. The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is (32/96)*100 = 33.33%, which rounds to 33%.",
