      "ground truth": "33",
      "llm_output": " James originally had 40 water type cards. After losing 8 and gaining 14, he will have 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 water type cards. In total, he will have 30 + 46 + 20 = 96 cards. The percentage chance of picking a water type card is 46/96 = 0.4791666... which is approximately 48%. The answer is 48%.",

      "ground truth": "54",
      "llm_output": " Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of 68, which is 10 + (68/2) = 10 + 34 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points. So Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. This means Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points. The answer is 54.",
