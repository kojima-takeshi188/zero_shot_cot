      "llm_output": "To answer these questions, we are using the longitude of each city. The longitude of a location is its angular distance east or west from the prime meridian (0\u00b0 longitude) in Greenwich, London. \n\nThe longitude of Seoul is 126\u00b058\u203239\u2033 E and the longitude of Los Angeles is 118\u00b014\u203234\u2033 W. \n\nWhen we subtract the longitude of Los Angeles from Seoul, we convert the west longitude to negative. \n\nSo, Seoul (126.98) - Los Angeles (-118.24) = 245.22\n\nHowever, the maximum possible value for longitude is 180 (as it ranges from -180 to 180), so we subtract the excess from 180.\n\nSo, 245.22 - 180 = 65.22\n\nWe round this to the nearest whole number for simplicity.\n\nThe answer is 65.",
