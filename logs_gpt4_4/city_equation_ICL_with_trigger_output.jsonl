The common way to do this is by using the alphabetic order where 'A' is 1 and 'Z' is 26 and summing the numerical values for each letter in the city's name.\n\nFor Sydney,\nS - 19\nY - 25\nD - 4\nN - 14\nE - 5\nY - 25\n\nSumming these up, Sydney equals 92. \n\nFor Johannesburg,\nJ - 10\nO - 15\nH - 8\nA - 1\nN - 14\nN - 14\nE - 5\nS - 19\nB - 2\nU - 21\nR - 18\nG - 7\n\nJohannesburg equals 124.\n\nThen, add the numerical values for Sydney (92) and Johannesburg (124) to get 216.\n\nThe answer is 216.",
